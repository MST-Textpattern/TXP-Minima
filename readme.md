## TXP Mimima

February 17, 2013

Welcome to the latest version of TXP Minima, a simple front-end theme for Textpattern based on the excellent **Foundation** framework by Zurb.

## Installation

To install this and use this theme, all you need to do is:

1. Install and activate the _glz_custom_fields_ plugin
2. Copy the included _default_, _archive_ and _error_default_ pages **over** your current page templates (back up first if you'd like to revert back to them later)
3. Set up the custom fields as set out in the /screenshots image folder
4. Ensure that you have the current **Foundation** folders and files (this download includes the current version - Foundation 3.2.0) installed on your server
5. Ensure you edit the page templates to add your own social links, fonts and a large favicon (64x64px) etc etcâ€¦
6. Use the custom fields as indicated when creating/editing your articles

## Theme specifics

The **TXP Minima** theme is designed to be used as a "tumblelog" style of blog. Users may enjoy the ability to set various pre-set _content types_ (blog, media, video, link, quote) and style each one accordingly.

To change the in-built markup for the content types, simply edit one of the custom field blocks in the *default* page template.

The style sheet - *site.css* - is designed to add and/or override style rules from *foundation.css*. Foundation by default uses *app.css* for this and you can copy/paste the styles to app.css if you prefer.
